\section{3D Image Demo}
We provide high resolution 3D images generated by Deep3D in three formats:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Anaglyph 3D: this format uses red vs green-blue channels to display the left and right eye views respectively.
It can be viewed with red-blue glasses.
\item Side-by-Side 3D: this format displays the two views side-by-side each with half width. It can be viewed with 3D media players on Oculus or 3D TVs.
\item GIF: this format displays the two views alternatively in a gif image. It can be viewed on normal screens without special glasses.
\end{enumerate}

\section{3D Movie Clip}
We provide 3D movie clips generated by Deep3D in two formats: anaglyph and side-by-side. The videos are encoded with X264 codec and should be playable with the VLC player.
