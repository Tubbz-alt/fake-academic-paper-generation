	Author={Hyung Suk Park, Sung Min Lee, Hwa Pyung Kim, and Jin Keun Seo},
	Subject={This paper proposes a sinogram-consistency learning method to deal with beam
		hardening related artifacts in polychromatic computerized tomography (CT). The presence of highly attenuating materials in the scan Ô¨Åeld causes an inconsistent sinogram, that does not match
		the range space of the Radon transform. When the mismatched data are entered into the range space during CT reconstruction, streaking and shading artifacts are generated owing to the inherent
		nature of the inverse Radon transform.},
